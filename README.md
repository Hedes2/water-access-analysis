# Analyzing Global Trends for Water Supply

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global water supply data, specifically looking at the percentage of the population served by the water supply industry. By studying historical trends and applying predictive modeling, the goal is to provide insights that can help stakeholders understand water accessibility and support future planning efforts.

## Data Source

The data comes from the Environment Statistics Database provided by the United Nations Statistics Division.

- United Nations Data: https://data.un.org/

## Project Objectives

- Analyze historical water supply data across different countries.
- Visualize trends to communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Build predictive models to forecast future water supply trends.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- Country or Area: Name of the country or region
- Year: The year the data was recorded
- Value: Percentage of the population with access to water supply
- Unit: Unit of measurement (percentage)

## Key Analysis Steps

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and prepared the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and explored relationships in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional variables to support modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applied machine learning to forecast future water supply trends.
- **Communication**: Summarized findings in a way thatâ€™s accessible to a wide audience.

## Summary of Insights

- Many countries have improved access to water supply over time.
- Some countries, like Albania and Algeria, have shown significant progress.
- Forecasts suggest continued positive growth in global water accessibility.

## Visualizations

The project includes:
- Line charts showing historical trends over time
- Bar charts explaining key drivers behind predictions
- Simple graphics summarizing key takeaways

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights global progress in access to water and helps project future trends. Through data-driven insights, it aims to support global efforts toward sustainable and equitable access to water resources.
